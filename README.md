The `create_send_rails` Gem drops into ActionMailer and sends transactional emails via the [Campaign Monitor API](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/), using its [Smart Email](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/transactional/#send_a_smart_email) feature. 

It updates ActionMailer so it defaults to JSON mailer views and allows you to define the data required for each of your mailers.

## Getting Started

To get started, add the following line to your applications `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'createsend-rails'
```
Then update your environment files and set `delivery_method` to `create_send` and include your CampaignMonitor `api_key` within the settings block.

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :create_send
config.action_mailer.create_send_settings = {
    api_key: 'INSERT_API_KEY'
}
```
Now go into your `views/*_mailer/` and add a `.json` view, which defines the data attributes required by your Smart Email template. Below is an example of a password reset email.  

```json
{
    "smart_email_id": "SMART_EMAIL_ID",
    "language": "<%= @user.language %>",
    "name": "<%= @user.name %>",
    "reset_url": "<%= @edit_password_reset_url %>"
}
```
